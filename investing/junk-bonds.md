# Junk Bonds

Bonds that carry a high risk of default (failure to pay interest or principle)
when compared to other bonds. These types of bonds are often issued by startups or coporations
who are struggling financially. Because of the additional risk, these bonds often
carry a higher dividend yield to offset the risk. Junk bonds often have the rating of BB or lower. 
New investors can diversify an minize risk with High Yield bonds or Junk Bonds by picking an ETF like
SPHD or SPYD.
