# Relative Deprivation Theory

The theory that people who feel deprived of some resource, luxury, or item that is considered "status quo" or essestial in society will work harder to obtain such things, but only under certain conditions. In other conditions, they will decide not to try.

Call deprived person: Person A

- Person A does not have X
- Person A knows that other people have X
- Person A wants X
- Person A believes he/she can realistically obtain X

Person A will put in the hard work to obtain X because Person A believes they have the ability to obtain X. Once obtaining X, person A will throttle their effort now that their standing is relative to their peers.

Now consider other deprived person: Person B

- Person B does not have X
- Person B knows that other people have X
- Person B wants X
- Person B does not realistically believe that he/she can obtain X, even though capable.

Person B will not try to obtain X. Person B believes that X is out of their reach, convinced that the other persons who have X are superior due to their relative standing.

This can be seen in Universities, where regardless of the prestige, graduation rate is consistent. Students in the top 3rd of the class get more than half the degrees, students in the bottom 3rd get less than 20 percent of the degrees, and the middle 3rd share the remaining 30 percent. Persistance in a field like STEM is not solely based on intelligence or cognitive ability, but also the feeling of relative standing to other peers. There is a tendency to throttle effort based on where we percieve we should be ranked rather than true capability. Top students convince all the others to put in less effort, since it is percieved as not possible.
